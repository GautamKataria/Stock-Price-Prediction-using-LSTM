# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
This is a repository containing the files used to deploy a deep learning stacked LSTM model to predict stock prices

unfortunately as the code size is heavy it cant be deployed on heroku due to slug size restrictions

but in the mean time,

you can use >streamlit run uiforstocks.py to run the app on your own machine/localhost
